Debugging Kubernetes pods can often feel like detective work, especially when your app crashes and the cause isn’t obvious. Traditional `kubectl` logs show you what happened, but not *how* it happened.  

That’s where **Traceloop** comes in. Traceloop is a **debugging and observability tool** that’s part of the **Inspektor Gadget ecosystem**, giving you the ability to record and replay what happens inside your pods; almost like having a “flight recorder” for your applications.  

In this guide, written by **Emidowojo Opaluwa** and published on **freeCodeCamp**, you’ll learn how to:  
- Set up Traceloop in your Kubernetes cluster  
- Capture and analyze pod behavior in real time  
- Debug production issues like crashes, permission errors, and network failures  
- Apply best practices for using Traceloop efficiently and securely
