eBPF is a widely known technology used in the observability, networking
and security landscapes. The Linux operating system provides a virtual
machine that can run eBPF programs in a secure and efficient way. Those
programs are attached to different hooks exposed by the operating system
to be able to filter and extract the information of interest when a
given event happens in the kernel.

In this blog post, we'll present BTFGen, a tool that helps to make eBPF
programs portable, and how it can be integrated in your project. We'll
explain the challenges of running eBPF programs on different target
machines, how this has been traditionally solved by compiling them
before loading, the problems it presents and how different mechanisms
and tools like CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere) and BTFHub try to
solve them.

# The problem

eBPF programs access the kernel structures to gather the data they need;
hence they are dependent on the layout of such structures and a program
compiled for a given kernel version usually doesn't work on another
one because the layout of their structures changes: a field is added,
removed, its type changed. Even a change to the kernel configuration
would change the whole structure layout. For instance, disabling `
CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK ` changes the offsets of all members of
[task_struct](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.16/include/linux/sched.h#L723):

```C
struct task_struct {
#ifdef CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK
	/*
	 * For reasons of header soup (see current_thread_info()), this
	 * must be the first element of task_struct.
	 */
	struct thread_info		thread_info;
#endif
	unsigned int			__state;

#ifdef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
	/* saved state for "spinlock sleepers" */
	unsigned int			saved_state;
#endif
...
```

This problem has usually been overcome by using the kernel headers of
the target machine to compile the programs before loading them. This is
the approach used by BPF Compiler Collection
([BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/)).

This approach has multiple drawbacks: (1) a heavy compiler chain must be
shipped to the target machine to compile the program, (2) compiling the
programs requires some resources and could affect the workload
scheduling in some scenarios, (3) compiling takes a considerable amount
of time and hence the first events arrive with some delay and (4) the
kernel headers need to be available on the target machine.

# CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere)

The CO-RE mechanism presents a solution to these problems. In this case,
the eBPF program is compiled once, then it's patched at runtime to
update its instructions according to the layout of the kernel structures
of machine where the program is going to run in. The [BPF CO-RE (Compile
Once – Run
Everywhere)](https://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-portability-and-co-re) blog
post presents all the details and components behind this technology.
What is important to understand for the scope of this blog post is that
CO-RE requires to have the BTF (BPF Type Format) information of the
target kernel. This is provided by the kernel itself when it's compiled
with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`. This option was [introduced in Linux
5.2](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e83b9f55448afce3fe1abcd1d10db9584f8042a6)
and many popular distributions only enabled it some versions after that.
This means that there are a lot of users running kernels that don't
expose BTF information and hence it's not possible to use CO-RE in those
cases.

# BTFHub

[BTFHub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub) is a project from the
Aqua Security folks that provides BTF information for the released
kernels of the most popular distributions that don't expose BTF
information. The BTF file for the target kernel can be downloaded at
runtime and then fed to the loader library (libbpf, cilium/ebpf or
others), that will use it to patch the program accordingly.

Even if BTFHub is a great improvement, it still presents some
challenges: each BTF file is a few MBs big, hence it's not possible
to ship the BTF files for all the kernels together with the application
as it'll require some GBs of space. The alternative is to download
the BTF for the current kernel at runtime, which also presents some
problems: it delays the starting of the eBPF program and in some
scenarios it's not possible to reach an external host to download
such a file.

# BTFGen

It's not needed to provide the full BTF file describing all the
kernel types to perform the program patching as an eBPF program usually
accesses only a few of them. A "reduced" BTF with only the
information about the types used will suffice. This is where BTFGen
comes into play: it's a tool that generates a reduced BTF file with
only the types that are needed by a set of eBPF programs. The generated
BTF files are very small (few KBs) and hence it's possible to ship
them together with the application.

BTFGen is not designed to be used alone. It needs the source BTF files
with all the kernel types for different Linux distributions (provided by
BTFHub) and the CO-RE mechanism (in libbpf, the Linux kernel or another
loader library) is still used to patch the program when loading it.

The workflow of BTFGen is the following:

1. Developers write their eBPF programs [using
   CO-RE](https://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-core-reference-guide/) and
   compile them with llvm/clang to generate the object files
2. The source BTF files for different distributions are gathered from
   BTFHub or another source
3. BTFGen is used to generate a reduced version of the BTF files
4. The reduced BTF files are distributed with the application

	<img src="/media/btfgen-workflow.svg" class="img-fluid" style="width: 35em;" alt="Image showing the BTFGen workflow as described above.">
</figure>

## Internal Details

BTFGen is implemented in bpftool and it uses the libbpf CO-RE logic to
solve relocations. With this information it's able to pick the types
involved in a relocation to generate the "reduced" BTF file. The goal of
this post is not to explain all the internal implementation details. If
you want to know more, you can check
[this](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/blob/main/docs/btfgen-internals.md)
documentation on the BTFHub repository or the
[patch](https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/164503621150.2935.6634904664671748900.git-patchwork-notify@kernel.org/T/#mdd100ccbc95947c8fe6be74db66002e273a29abd)
where it was implemented.

## How to Use?

This section provides more details about the usage of this utility. In
this example we'll use BTFGen to enable running some of the [BCC
libbpf-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/v0.24.0/libbpf-tools)
on machines without `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` enabled. A very similar
approach can be used to integrate with other eBPF applications.

In this demonstration we will go through the following steps:

1. Download, compile and install a version of bpftool with BTFGen support
2. Download BTF files from BTFHub
3. Download and compile BCC tools
4. Use BTFGen to generate "reduced" BTF files for some BCC tools
5. Modify those tools to load the BTF information from a custom path
6. Try it out

As a first step, let's create an empty folder for this demonstration:

```bash
$ mkdir /tmp/btfgendemo
```

### Installing bpftool

BTFGen was just merged into bpftool. Until it's included in the
packages of the different distributions, we need to compile it from
source.

```bash
$ cd /tmp/btfgendemo
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool.git
$ cd bpftool/src
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### Get BTF files for different kernels from BFThub

In this case we use BTFHub and we only consider Ubuntu Focal for brevity
but exactly the same approach is used to generate files for other
distributions supported by BTFHub.

```bash
$ cd /tmp/btfgendemo
$ git clone https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub-archive
$ cd btfhub-archive/ubuntu/focal/x86_64/
$ for f in *.tar.xz; do tar -xf "$f"; done
$ ls -lhn *.btf | head
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,5M Sep 29 13:36 5.11.0-1007-azure.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,8M Aug 10 23:33 5.11.0-1009-aws.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,8M Jan 22 12:29 5.11.0-1009-gcp.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,5M Sep 29 13:38 5.11.0-1012-azure.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,5M Sep 29 13:40 5.11.0-1013-azure.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,8M Aug 10 23:39 5.11.0-1014-aws.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,8M Jan 22 12:32 5.11.0-1014-gcp.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,5M Sep 29 13:43 5.11.0-1015-azure.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,8M Sep 7 22:52 5.11.0-1016-aws.btf
-rw-r----- 1 1000 1000 4,8M Sep 7 22:57 5.11.0-1017-aws.btf
```

As you can see, the size of the BTF file for each kernel is around 4 MB.

```bash
$ find . -name "*.btf" | xargs du -ch | tail -n 1
944M	total
```

And the total size of the files, only for Ubuntu Focal, is ~944MB, which
makes it infeasible to ship them together with the application.

### Download, modify and compile BCC libbpf tools

Let's clone the BCC repository at the v0.24.0 tag.

```bash
$ cd /tmp/btfgendemo
$ git clone https://github.com/iovisor/bcc -b v0.24.0 --recursive
```

By default, the different BCC tools try to load BTF information from
a
[well-known](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/blob/22411acc4b2c846868fd570b2d9f3b016d2af2cb/src/btf.c#L4631-L4639)
list of directories. We shouldn't overwrite those files in our system,
as they might be needed by other tools. Instead, we can modify some of
the BCC tools to load the BTF information from a custom path. We can use
`LIBBPF_OPTS()` to declare a `bpf_object_open_opts` struct with the
`btf_custom_path` field set to the path where the BTF resides and pass it
to the `TOOL_bpf__open_opts()` function. You can apply the following patch
to modify the opensnoop, execsnoop and bindsnoop tools.

```patch

```bash

$ git apply /tmp/btfgendemo/bcc.patch
$ cd libbpf-tools/
$ make -j$(nproc)
```

### Generate "reduced" BTF

In this step, we'll use the `bpftool gen min_core_btf` command to
generate the reduced BTF files for the bindsnoop, execsnoop and
opensnoop BCC tools. The following command invokes bpftool for each BTF
file present in the directory.

```bash
$ OBJ1=/tmp/btfgendemo/bcc/libbpf-tools/.output/bindsnoop.bpf.o
$ OBJ2=/tmp/btfgendemo/bcc/libbpf-tools/.output/execsnoop.bpf.o
$ OBJ3=/tmp/btfgendemo/bcc/libbpf-tools/.output/opensnoop.bpf.o

$ mkdir -p /tmp/btfgendemo/btfs
$ cd /tmp/btfgendemo/btfhub-archive/ubuntu/focal/x86_64/

$ for f in *.btf; do bpftool gen min_core_btf "$f" \
  /tmp/btfgendemo/btfs/$(basename "$f") $OBJ1 $OBJ2 $OBJ3; \
done

$ ls -lhn /tmp/btfgendemo/btfs | head
total 864K
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1007-azure.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1009-aws.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1009-gcp.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1012-azure.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1013-azure.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1014-aws.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1014-gcp.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1015-azure.btf
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1,1K Feb 8 14:46 5.11.0-1016-aws.btf
```

Each generated BTF file is around 1.1KB and the size of all generated
files for Ubuntu Focal is 864KB, which makes it possible to ship them
together with the applications.

We can even optimize it more if we compress the generated files:

```bash
$ cd /tmp/btfgendemo/btfs
$ tar cvfJ compressed.tar.xz *.btf
$ ls -lhn compressed.tar.xz
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 2,5K Feb 17 15:19 compressed.tar.xz
```

The compression rate is so high because many of the generated files are
identical, we will discuss it in further detail below.

### Try it out

In order to try it out we need to run a machine with Ubuntu Focal. The
following Vagrantfile can be used to create a VM with it. Please note
that Ubuntu Focal has enabled BTF support starting from kernel version
5.4.0-92-generic, so we need to run a previous version to make sure this
example makes sense. We use the `202012.21.0` version of the
`bento/ubuntu-20.04` Vagrant box that has kernel 5.4.0-58-generic.

This uses `sshfs` to share files between the host and the VM, be sure
that you have the `vagrant-sshfs` plugin installed.

```Vagrantfile
# /tmp/btfgendemo/Vagrantfile
Vagrant.configure("2") do | config |
  config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-20.04"
  config.vm.box_version = "= 202012.21.0"
  config.vm.synced_folder "/tmp/btfgendemo", "/btfgendemo", type: "sshfs"

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do | vb |
    vb.gui = false
    vb.cpus = 4
    vb.memory = "4096"
  end
end
```

Bring the VM up and SSH into it:

```bash
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

The following commands must be executed inside the VM.

Check the kernel version:

```bash
$ uname -a
Linux vagrant 5.4.0-58-generic #64-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 9 08:16:25 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

Let's check that the kernel doesn't have `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` enabled.

```bash
$ cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF is not set
```

Let's try to run some of the tools before copying the BTF file to the correct path.

```bash
$ sudo /btfgendemo/bcc/libbpf-tools/execsnoop
libbpf: failed to parse target BTF: -2
libbpf: failed to perform CO-RE relocations: -2
libbpf: failed to load object 'execsnoop_bpf'
libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton 'execsnoop_bpf': -2
failed to load BPF object: -2
```

As expected, the tool is failing because it's not able to find the
BTF information required to perform the CO-RE relocations.

Let's copy the the BTF file corresponding to this kernel version.

```bash
$ cp /btfgendemo/btfs/$(uname -r).btf /tmp/vmlinux.btf
```

After this, the tools work fine:

```bash
$ sudo /btfgendemo/bcc/libbpf-tools/execsnoop
PCOMM PID PPID RET ARGS
^C

$ sudo /btfgendemo/bcc/libbpf-tools/bindsnoop
PID COMM RET PROTO OPTS IF PORT ADDR
^C

$ sudo /btfgendemo/bcc/libbpf-tools/opensnoop
PID COMM FD ERR PATH
^C
```

Of course this is just an example showing the general workflow of the tool.
A real integration should take care of automatically providing the right
BTF file based on the kernel version of the host. The following section
shows two different examples of this integration.

## Example of integrations

In this section we'll cover how BTFGen is being used by the Inspektor
Gadget and Tracee projects.

### Inspektor Gadget

[Inspektor Gadget](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget) is a
collection of tools to debug and inspect Kubernetes resources and
applications. Since it's distributed as a container image, we chose to
ship the BTF files for the different Linux distributions within it. We
added a [step](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/blob/v0.4.2/gadget.Dockerfile#L42-L46) to the Dockerfile to generate the BTF files when building
the container image:

```bash
RUN set -ex; \
	if [ "$ENABLE_BTFGEN" = true ]; then \
		cd /btf-tools && \
		LIBBPFTOOLS=/objs BTFHUB=/tmp/btfhub INSPEKTOR_GADGET=/gadget ./btfgen.sh; \
	fi
```

[btfgen.sh](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/blob/v0.4.2/tools/btfgen.sh)
is a helper script that invokes bpftool generating BTF files for all
kernels supported by BTFHub.

Then, we modified the
[entrypoint](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/blob/v0.4.2/gadget-container/entrypoint.sh#L149-L154)
script to install the right BTF file on the container filesystem, so the
different gadgets have it available. Inspektor Gadget is designed to
always run in a container, hence we can install the BTF file in a system
path (`/boot/vmlinux-$(uname –r)`) without affecting the host. By doing so
we also avoid modifying the source code of the different BCC tools (as
we did in the example above):

```bash
echo "Kernel provided BTF is not available: Trying shipped BTF files"
SOURCE_BTF=/btfs/$ID/$VERSION_ID/$ARCH/$KERNEL.btf
if [-f $SOURCE_BTF]; then
        objcopy --input binary --output elf64-little --rename-section .data=.BTF $SOURCE_BTF /boot/vmlinux-$KERNEL
        echo "shipped BTF available. Installed at /boot/vmlinux-$KERNEL"
else
...
```

The whole PR introducing this support was [https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/pull/387](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/pull/387).


### Tracee

[Tracee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee) is a Runtime Security
and forensics tool for Linux. In this case the generated BTF files are
embedded within the application binary. The Makefile has a
[btfhub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/add1efa7934dcf46be67ea2be54ac0d139a94804/Makefile.one#L507)
target that invokes
[btfhub.sh.](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/add1efa7934dcf46be67ea2be54ac0d139a94804/3rdparty/btfhub.sh#L1)
This script clones the BTFHub repository and
[calls](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/add1efa7934dcf46be67ea2be54ac0d139a94804/3rdparty/btfhub.sh#L112)
btfgen.sh to generate the BTF files. Those files are moved to the
`./dist/btfhub` folder.

```bash
# generate tailored BTFs

[ ! -f ./tools/btfgen.sh ] && die "could not find btfgen.sh"
./tools/btfgen.sh -a ${ARCH} -o $TRACEE_BPF_CORE

# move tailored BTFs to dist

[ ! -d ${BASEDIR}/dist ] && die "could not find dist directory"
[ ! -d ${BASEDIR}/dist/btfhub ] && mkdir ${BASEDIR}/dist/btfhub

rm -rf ${BASEDIR}/dist/btfhub/*
mv ./custom-archive/* ${BASEDIR}/dist/btfhub
```

Then, they are embedded in the go binary using [`go:embed`](https://pkg.go.dev/embed)
[here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/add1efa7934dcf46be67ea2be54ac0d139a94804/embedded-ebpf.go#L11).

```go
//go:build ebpf
// +build ebpf

package tracee

import (
	"embed"
)

//go:embed "dist/tracee.bpf.core.o"
//go:embed "dist/btfhub/*"

var BPFBundleInjected embed.FS
```

At runtime, the BTF file for the current kernel is
[unpacked](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/add1efa7934dcf46be67ea2be54ac0d139a94804/cmd/tracee-ebpf/main.go#L367)
and its path
[passed](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/add1efa7934dcf46be67ea2be54ac0d139a94804/cmd/tracee-ebpf/main.go#L373)
to libbpfgo to be used for the CO-RE relocations.

## Limitations

The BTF support in the kernel is not only about exposing the BTF types.
Some kind of eBPF programs like fentry/fexit and LSM hooks require the
kernel to expose BTF information. Those programs won't work with BTFGen
and the only alternative is to have a kernel with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF`
enabled.

## Future Ahead / Next Steps

We are aware that BTFGen is a temporary solution until most
systems are updated to a kernel version that exposes BTF information.
However, we think it's going to take some years and, in the meanwhile,
BTFGen can help to fill that gap.

The following are some improvements / next steps that we could consider
soon.

### Integration with other projects

Some projects like BCC and its libbpf-based tools could benefit a lot
from an integration with BTFGen. We opened a
[PR](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/3889) to make those tools
available to a wider range of Linux distributions by using BTFGen.

### Deduplication of generated files

eBPF programs usually access few kernel types, hence there is a high
chance that the generated files for two different kernel versions are
identical, this is especially true for different minor releases of
kernels of the same Linux distribution. A further improvement to BTFGen
would be to take advantage of this to avoid creating duplicated files by
using a symbolic link or a similar approach.

This could also be done directly on BTFHub where some source BTF files
are duplicated like indicated in
[this](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/issues/17) issue, even if
in this case the chance of having duplicated files is lower.

### Online API

BTFHub is a big repository, and its size continues to increase because
new kernels are released over time. The folks from Seekret created an
[API](https://github.com/seek-ret/btfhub-online) that uses BTFGen and
BTFHub to generate on demand the "reduced" BTF files for eBPF objects
provided by a user.

# Thanks

This feature took inspiration from already existing projects and was
implemented as a joint effort by different companies. First, we'd like
to thank the Aqua Security team for their amazing work on BTFHub, that's
the base project we took inspiration from. Secondly, we'd like to thank
the different people that contributed during the development of this
feature: Rafael David Tinoco from Aqua Security and Lorenzo Fontana and
Leonardo Di Donato from Elastic. Finally, the maintainers of libbpf,
Andrii Nakryiko and Alexei Starovoitov and of bpftool, Quentin Monnet,
who provided a lot of valuable feedback and guidance to implement it.
