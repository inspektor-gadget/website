One of the things we do in the Kinvolk Labs team is provide expert technical
consulting for customers who are experiencing issues with their Kubernetes or
Linux environments — from security audits to networking troubles to
troubleshooting puzzling performance problems.

A few weeks back, video advertising technology company
[Smartclip](https://www.smartclip.com) reached out to us at Kinvolk to
investigate performance issues with their Kubernetes deployment. In this blog
post, I will give you some insight into our processes and explain how we
rapidly identified and solved the problem, using BPF tools from the BCC
project. Finally, I’ll explain how Inspektor Gadget enables you to easily have
access to these same BPF tools for your own Kubernetes installation.

## Description of the problem

The Kubernetes cluster runs, among other things, nginx with fluentd and Apache
Flume to handle logs. After deploying a new version of Kubernetes, the devops
team noticed a performance regression issue in fluentd: it became unable to
handle the logs fast enough and it kept buffering the logs until it reached the
limit.

Unfortunately, that regression issue was only visible after a few days in
production and, despite the team’s attempts to create a reproduction scenario
in a dev environment, could not be reproduced in testing outside of production.
It was also more likely to happen in the evening when there is more traffic to
handle.

## Initial ideas to investigate

The upgrade implied several changes: a new version of the Linux kernel, a new
version of Kubernetes, a different Docker version, etc. In order to find out
which change caused the problem, the Smartclip team isolated the different
changes one by one until they found the one change that caused the regression
issue: updating from Kubernetes v1.14.4 to v1.16.4.

It was surprising at first: I didn’t see any reason why any Kubernetes
component  (kube-apiserver, controller managers, kubelet, etc.) should cause
the applications (fluentd and Apache Flume) to go slower.

I was given ssh access to one good node (running Kubernetes v1.14.4) and one
bad node (running v1.16.4) so I could find out what was the difference between
them. My initial ideas were to compare the following between the two nodes:

- Linux distribution version
- Kernel version and configuration
- Docker version
- Cgroup configuration of the pod (cpu, blkio)
- Docker image used by the pods
 -Kubelet configuration

However, I didn’t see any difference between the good node and the bad node.

## Using the BCC CPU profiler

The [BPF Compiler Collection (BCC) project](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)
contains tools for performance analysis. One of them is a [CPU
profiler](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/profile_example.txt):
it works by taking samples of kernel or userspace stack traces at timed
intervals, and counting how many times each of them is visible.

The performance issue only happened in production and it is not advisable to
install new tools on production nodes without testing. Fortunately, BCC and its
CPU profiler can be executed as a container without installing it on the node.

```
docker run --rm -ti --privileged \
    --net=host --pid=host \
    -v /usr/src:/usr/src \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
    docker.io/kinvolk/bcc \
    /usr/share/bcc/tools/profile -d -f -K -p $FLUENTD_PID 10
```

You can find the container image in Kinvolk's public container repository at
`docker.io/kinvolk/bcc`. If for some reason you need to build your own image,
you can use the new section in the GitHub action that we [contributed
upstream](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/2797) a month ago.

This command prints the kernel stack traces ordered by frequency, from the
least frequent to the most frequent. This allows the user to look at the last
lines of the output to get the most significant ones. The last line of the
output was this kernel stack:

```
thread.rb:70;xen_hvm_callback_vector;xen_evtchn_do_upcall;irq_exit;__softirqentry_text_start;net_rx_action;ena_io_poll;ena_clean_rx_irq;napi_gro_receive;netif_receive_skb_internal;__netif_receive_skb;__netif_receive_skb_core;ip_rcv;ip_rcv_finish;ip_forward;ip_forward_finish;ip_output;ip_finish_output;ip_finish_output2;dev_queue_xmit;__dev_queue_xmit;__qdisc_run;sch_direct_xmit;dev_hard_start_xmit;br_dev_xmit;br_forward;__br_forward;nf_hook_slow;ebt_out_hook;ebt_in_hook;ebt_ip_mt;ebt_ip_mt 3
```

This stack with the function `ebt_ip_mt()` is listed only on the bad node. We
found a different behaviour between the good node and the bad node. It is worth
exploring this.

## Analysis of the problem

Looking at the kernel sources, `ebt_ip_mt()` is part of Netfilter, responsible
for filtering packets at the data link layer. Many people are familiar with the
`iptables` command to check the firewall rules at the network and transport
layer, but Netfilter also has the command `ebtables` for the firewall rules at
the data link layer.

{{< figure src="/media/ebtables.png" class="img-fluid">}}

This gives the idea to check the bridging firewall rules with `ebtables -L`. On
the bad node, I notice the following:

```
Bridge chain: KUBE-DEDUP, entries: 4268, policy: ACCEPT
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
-p IPv4 -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.0/24 -j DROP
(...)
```

The same rule is repeated thousands of times in the `KUBE-DEDUP` chain. This
means that each network packet will be evaluated against that rule thousands of
times. The chain name `KUBE-DEDUP` suggests that it was not a rule added
manually but programmatically by Kubernetes. This looks like a bug.

Searching in the Kubernetes sources, I found that the kubenet network plugin
used in the Kubernetes cluster indeed adds such a rule, but there is a function
that specifically checks if the rule is already added, to avoid adding it
several times. Obviously, there is something wrong with that check.

At this point, in order to see how kubenet is using ebtables exactly, I turned
to another BCC tool:
[execsnoop](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/execsnoop_example.txt).
This traces new processes and displays the command line for each of them. Since
I am only interested in the `ebtables` process, I just add a `grep ebtables`
and let this run for an afternoon until I see kubenet executing ebtables.

```
docker run --rm -ti --privileged \
    --net=host --pid=host \
    -v /usr/src:/usr/src \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules \
    -v /sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug \
    docker.io/kinvolk/bcc \
    /usr/share/bcc/tools/execsnoop  \
        | grep ebtables
```

After a few hours, I get some interesting output:

```
ebtables         5260   2411     0 /sbin/ebtables --version
ebtables         5261   2411     0 /sbin/ebtables -t filter -L KUBE-DEDUP
ebtables         5262   2411     0 /sbin/ebtables -t filter -L OUTPUT --Lmac2
ebtables         5263   2411     0 /sbin/ebtables -t filter -L KUBE-DEDUP --Lmac2
ebtables         5264   2411     0 /sbin/ebtables -t filter -L KUBE-DEDUP --Lmac2
ebtables         5265   2411     0 /sbin/ebtables -t filter -A KUBE-DEDUP -p IPv4
                      -s e2:3f:9b:74:a8:7a -o veth+ --ip-src 10.2.207.1/24 -j DROP
```

We see kubenet listing the rules in the KUBE-DEDUP chain, and then proceeding
to add the rule. However, the rule shown in the command line is slightly
different from the rule listed above: kubenet adds `10.2.207.1/24` but then
ebtables lists `10.2.207.0/24`. If you’re familiar with
[netmask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork), you’ll know that ebtables
is doing the right thing to discard the final “.1” on a `/24` netmask. Here is
what’s happening:

- Kubenet lists the rules to check if the rule with `10.2.207.1/24` is there.
- Kubenet does not find it in `ebtables -L`’ output because it lists the rules with `10.2.207.0/24`.
- So Kubenet runs the `ebtables -A` command to append a new rule.
- `ebtables` parses the rule, discards the `.1` and appends the rule with `10.2.207.0/24`.
- Each time this process is repeated, a new rule is added. Over time, the rule can be repeated thousands of times.

I reported the bug at https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/89633
with the links to the lines of code that cause the issue. The bug was
introduced in v1.16.0 and fixed in v1.18.0 with backports in v1.16.8 and
v1.17.3.

For Smartclip, the issue is resolved by upgrading to a Kubernetes version with
the fix. Monitoring on the ebtables rules list was also added in order to
trigger an alert when the amount of rules is excessive, just in case this issue
happens again.

## Bringing the BCC CPU profiler into Inspektor Gadget

When managing a cluster in production, it is good practice to focus on
automation and avoid interacting with individual nodes, individual pods or
individual processes. However, in order to investigate the issue, I needed SSH
access to the Kubernetes nodes and I identified the pod with fluentd and its
main PID. Then I launched a new container containing the BCC tools and executed
the CPU profiler on the fluentd PID. This is error-prone and more complicated
than it could have been.

Inspektor Gadget exists in order to make this process easier for Kubernetes
system administrators. You can now achieve everything I did from the kubectl
command line with `kubectl gadget profile` without needing to SSH to the nodes.
The execsnoop BCC tool is also available via `kubectl gadget execsnoop`. Under
the hood, Inspektor Gadget will execute the BPF programs on the nodes to get
traces from the right pods which can be selected with Kubernetes labels — no
need to SSH into the nodes, nor to work out the PIDs you need to attach the BPF
program to.

Following this investigation, we released a [new version of Inspektor
Gadget](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.5)
including both `profile` and `execsnoop`. We also show examples how to use
[profile](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/blob/master/Documentation/demo-profile.md)
and
[execsnoop](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/blob/master/Documentation/demo-execsnoop.md).

As René Wagner, technical director data platforms at Smartclip, summarized the
engagement: “Through their knowledge of the latest Linux kernel technologies,
the Kinvolk Labs team got to the bottom of our problem in a couple of days. We
were really impressed by their expertise and recommend their services to anyone
in a similarly challenging situation. As a bonus outcome from the project, we
are also really happy to have discovered Inspektor Gadget, which is now an
essential tool for all our Kubernetes admins.”

If you have used Inspektor Gadget and find it useful, or have a suggestion for
a useful gadget we could add, please [let us know](mailto:hello@kinvolk.io), or
(even better) let the world know (tweet @kinvolkio with #InspektorGadget).
